# MachineLearning-jupyter
In this repository, you can find Jupyter notebooks files with data analyzing, data visualization, and prediction models all written in **Python**. <br>
In the future, I want to become a **machine learning engineer**. I would like so much to work with AI. To do that I study machine learning every day. My bachelor thesis was about genetic algorithms and as a topic of my master thesis, I have chosen data mining.

***Artificial intelligence*** will play a significant role in humans life. It already is commonly used in medicine, security, analyzing data, and in many other fields. I want to understand how it works, how it can be used to ***help people***. I want to come up with new ideas and build new solutions using AI that can make our life a bit better and easier.
